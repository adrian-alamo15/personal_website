    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a first-generation, underrepresented Computer Science student from the inner-city of Los Angeles, CA attending Title I schools throughout my K-12 years. I have a passion for leveraging modern technologies such as AI and software development to drive innovation and solve real-world challenges. Currently pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, with coursework encompassing diverse areas such as data science, algorithms, computer security, computer architecture, engineering optimizations. Skilled in programming languages including Java, C, Python, Go and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

    <p>
        With a strong foundation in software development and data analysis, I have successfully completed projects that demonstrate my ability to design and implement solutions. Notably, I developed an end-to-end encrypted file sharing system utilizing cryptography and secure API design. I also contributed to a Google Maps-inspired project of the City of Berkeley, integrating AI algorithms for efficient navigation.

        During my internship as a Robotics Software Engineering INROADS Intern at CreateMe, I took ownership of a full-stack flask web application project for a mathematical simulation of one of the company's main robotic projects. Additionally, I gained experience in object detection software and deep reinforcement learning projects. My strong problem-solving skills, coupled with knowledge of Azure, Git, and Docker, allowed me to contribute to high-level robotic and automation software systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills and contribute to cutting-edge projects and research in areas such as software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Let's connect and explore ways we can collaborate to drive innovation in the field of computer science!
