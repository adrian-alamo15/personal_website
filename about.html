        My name is Adrian Alamo, and I was born and raised in Westlake, Los Angeles, CA, where I primarily attended 
        Title I schools from K-12. I am set to graduate from the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 2025 with a B.A. 
        in Computer Science and a Minor in Chicanx/Latinx Studies. Throughout my academic career, I have gained expertise in 
        data science, computer security, and software development, with proficiency in languages including Java, C, Python, and assembly.

                <p>
        In addition to my coursework, I collaborated with Professor Pablo Gonzalez from the Ethnic Studies Department to develop ARES, 
        an Augmented Reality app that offers a virtual tour of UC Berkeley's political history using geolocation and AR technology. 
        This project was completed in partnership with the Ethnic Studies Changemaker Studios. [More information on the app here.]
                </p>

                <p>
        In Summer 2021, I began working at a year-long internship with a startup company called CreateMe Technologies in San Francisco, 
        where I contributed to robotics software development and led the creation of a full-stack Flask web application for a robotics simulation. 
        During my time at CreateMe, I gained hands-on experience in object detection, deep reinforcement learning, and worked with tools 
        such as Azure, Git, and Docker to support automation and robotics systems.
                </p>

                <p>
        After my internship, in Fall 2022 I helped co-found an early-stage startup with my fraternity brothers, where I led the 
        Data Science team in building the company's database and developing machine learning models for user preference recommendations. 
        I am currently working with this project part time and eager to go public soon! [More information on the company here.]
                </p>
                <p>
        I am now eager to apply my technical skills to impactful projects in software development and machine learning. I look forward 
        to connecting with like-minded professionals who are passionate about using technology to drive innovation.
