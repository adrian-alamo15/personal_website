                <p>
                    I’m Adrian Alamo, a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where I earned a B.A. in Computer Science 
                    with a Minor in Chicanx/Latinx Studies. Born and raised in Westlake, Los Angeles, I’ve built my path around curiosity, 
                    persistence, and a passion for creating technology that drives meaningful impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My technical expertise spans software development, data science, and computer security, with proficiency in Java, C, Python, 
                    and assembly. I’ve applied these skills through hands-on projects—most notably developing ARES, an augmented reality 
                    app showcasing UC Berkeley’s political history, in collaboration with Professor Pablo Gonzalez and the Ethnic Studies 
                    Changemaker Studios.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Previously, I interned at CreateMe Technologies, a San Francisco robotics startup, where I contributed to automation 
                    and simulation software, built a full-stack Flask web application, and worked with object detection, deep reinforcement 
                    learning, and tools like Azure, Git, and Docker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I currently serve as the Data Science Lead at SingleMLT, an early-stage startup I co-founded, where I design database 
                    architecture and develop machine learning models for personalized user recommendations. I’m passionate about 
                    leveraging technology to build innovative, data-driven systems that bridge creativity and impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m now eager to apply my technical skills to impactful projects in software development and machine learning. I look forward 
                    to connecting with like-minded professionals who are passionate about using technology to drive innovation.
                </p>
