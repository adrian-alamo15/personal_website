                 data-description="Designed an RNN model to identify the language of individual words in a provided test. Used a database encompassing vocabulary from 5 languages: English, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, and Polish. The RNN effectively managed variable-length inputs to take account of variations to word lengths across 47 unique characters. The RNN model consistently achieved a language identification accuracy greater than 90%."
